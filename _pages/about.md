I am a Ph.D. student since 2023 in the [Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Space-Aerial Networking & Intelligent Sensing](http://eie.hitsz.edu.cn/English.htm) at Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, advised by Prof. [Zhang Tingting](https://faculty.hitsz.edu.cn/zhangtingting). 
My research focuses on the intersection of machine learning and robotics, with a particular focus on sensor fusion data, deep representation learning, generative models and sensori-motor control in the context of autonomous systems.
<!-- Currently, I am exploring open-world 3D scene understanding algorithms that leverage the power of 2D foundation models. -->

I earned my MEng in Software Engineering from [Nankai University](https://csen.nankai.edu.cn/), in 2023, where I was advised by Prof. [Mengting Hu](https://hmt2014.github.io/homepage/).
